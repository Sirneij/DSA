# Binary Search Implementation

> Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

> The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to $O(\log n)$.

These implementations are written in `C/C++`, `Go`, `JavaScript`, and `Python` for learning purposes.
